# web-scraping-challenge

I don't know if there is something to be addressed here for the first half of the data scraping, so on to the second half, we have the following questions:
## Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:


### How many months exist on Mars?
I am not quite sure how to answer this, as there are two different ways to approach it. One is by the Martian annual cycle, and one is by the numbers of the data set. As I do not know how to obtain the former from this data, the answer to the latter is 12 unique months.

### How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
There are 1867 days present in the data.

### What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
This was already answered in the starter code, being 3rd as the coldest and 8th as the warmest.

### Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
Again, already answered, it is lowest in the 6th and highest in the 9th.

### About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? 
Though kind of answered already, we can safely say between 660 and 680 Earth days exist in a Martian year by observing one cosinusoidal wave.




With all that in mind, all data is within the "mars_scrape" folder
